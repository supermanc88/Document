# - Execute the "build" command to make the sample FSD driver

# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.

TARGETNAME=sfsd

# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or
# BOOTPGM).  UMAPPL_NOLIB is used when you're only building user-mode
# apps and don't need to build a library.

TARGETPATH=obj

TARGETTYPE=DRIVER

# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.  The INCLUDES
# variable is not required.  Specifying an empty INCLUDES variable
# (i.e. INCLUDES= ) indicates no include paths are to be searched.
#
# NOTE: The "fsdk\inc" refers to the Microsoft supplied Installable File Systems
#       Developers Kit.
INCLUDES=..\inc;\ddk-40\inc;\fsdk\inc-40;

# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
# The SOURCES variable is required.  If there are no platform common source
# files, an empty SOURCES variable should be used. (i.e. SOURCES= )

# Source files common to multiple platforms
