# - Execute the "build" command to make the sample filter driver

# The MAJORCOMP and MINORCOMP variables are defined
# so that $(MAJORCOMP)$(MINORCOMP)filename can be used in
# cross compiling to provide unique filenames in a flat namespace.

# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.

TARGETNAME=sfilter

# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target.

TARGETPATH=obj

TARGETTYPE=DRIVER

# The TARGETLIBS specifies additional libraries to link with you target
# image.  Each library path specification should contain an asterisk (*)
# where the machine specific subdirectory name should go.

#TARGETLIBS=

# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.  The INCLUDES
# variable is not required.  Specifying an empty INCLUDES variable
# (i.e. INCLUDES= ) indicates no include paths are to be searched.
#
# NOTE: The "fsdk\inc" refers to the Microsoft supplied File Systems
#       Developers Kit include directory.

INCLUDES=..\inc;\ddk-40\inc;\fsdk\inc-40;

# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
# The SOURCES variable is required.  If there are no platform common source
# files, an empty SOURCES variable should be used. (i.e. SOURCES= )

# Source files common to multiple platforms

# Next specify any additional options for the compiler.

# Next specify options for the linker.
#

# DLLBASE=0x62900000
# DLLENTRY=LibMain

# specify which C runtimes to link with (default is libc.lib)

# USE_CRTDLL=1    (link with crtdll.lib)
# USE_LIBCMT=1    (link with libcmt.lib)

# Next specify one or more user mode test programs and their type
# UMTEST is used for optional test programs.  UMAPPL is used for
# programs that always get built when the directory is built.

# UMTYPE=nt
# UMTEST=foo*baz
# UMAPPL=foo*baz

# Defining either (or both) the variables NTTARGETFILE0 and/or NTTARGETFILES
# will cause MAKEFILE.DEF to include .\makefile.inc immediately after it
# specifies the top level targets (all, clean and loc) and their dependencies.
# MAKEFILE.DEF also expands NTTARGETFILE0 as the first dependent for the
# "all" target and NTTARGETFILES as the last dependent for the "all" target.
# Useful for specifying additional targets and dependencies that don't fit the
# general case covered by MAKEFILE.DEF

# NTTARGETFILE0 is built before all other compiles specified in the sources
# file.

# NTTARGETFILE1 is built after all other compiles specified in the sources
# file but before the link step.

# NTTARGETFILES is built after all compiles/links specified by the
# sources file.

# NTTARGETFILE0=
# NTTARGETFILE1=
# NTTARGETFILES=

# Profiling for the working set tuner can be enabled by specifying the
# NTPROFILEINPUT variable.  Examine the VGA display driver and perf samples
